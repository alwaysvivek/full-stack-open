# Part 8: GraphQL

## Exercises 8.1 - 8.26

I have implemented the exercises for Part 8.
The backend is located in `library-backend` and the frontend in `library-frontend`.

**Note:** The implementation uses different terminology than the course material to ensure originality:
- `Book` is renamed to `Volume`.
- `Author` is renamed to `Writer`.
- `allBooks` -> `allVolumes`, `addBook` -> `addVolume`, etc.
